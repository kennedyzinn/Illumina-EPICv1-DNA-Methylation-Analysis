# Illumina-EPICv1-DNA-Methylation-Analysis
Pre-processing, differential methylation analysis, differential variation analysis, and pathway analysis of Illumina EPICv1 microarray data using R.
The two R files (process_microarry and region_analysis) are user defined functions executed in the R markdown files.

Current state of the files are messy in explanation and execution. This is my first time analyzing DNA methylation data, so this is a work in progress. Updates and improvements will be made regularly.

The following sources have been essential in allowing me to complete these projects;
