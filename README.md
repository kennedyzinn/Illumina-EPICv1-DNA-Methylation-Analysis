# Illumina-EPICv1-DNA-Methylation-Analysis
Pre-processing, differential methylation analysis, differential variation analysis, and pathway analysis of Illumina EPICv1 microarray data using R.
SMC, NCC and IPSC files are nearly identical, excluding minor changes necessary for the various samples analyzed.
The two R files (process_microarry and region_analysis) are user defined functions executed in the R markdown files.

Current state of the files are messy in explanation and execution. This is my first time analyzing DNA methylation data, so this is a work in progress. Updates and improvements will be made regularly
